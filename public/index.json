[{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"01","image":null,"permalink":"/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":null,"contents":" What types of charts do you make? We admit, we love bar charts and treemaps (hierarchical data charts). We work with you to ensure that the charts or dashboards we create are the best match for your data. (Heat maps, Bubble Charts, Line Charts, Tables, Filter, Search, etc.)\n  What types of maps do you make? “Choropleth” maps are a popular thematic map type. Choropleth maps use colors, shading patterns or symbols to represent data within areas such as counties or legislative districts. Optionally, we can add an underlying street map to help users to orient. We like to build interactive maps which reveal data details as you move your mouse over a district or region. (Of course, we can link to your organization’s published reports. We expect that more people will engage with interactive visualizations than read your reports.)\n  Is it complicated for our organization to work with you to make a map? No! Simply decide what you want to map, and provide accurate data in a Google spreadsheet. We will work through a checklist system of to-dos to ensure that your map meets your needs and your deadline.\n  We score every legislator in our state. Can we enable users to tweet their legislators’ scores? Yes. We had one client build custom tweets and custom form emails for every single state legislator. In the following year they decided that was too much work, and we built a default tweet for each score range.\n  Can we get support with the map launch? Yes. Our team is skilled in social media. We can create engaging images, and appropriate “open graph tags” to ensure successful social sharing on platforms such as Facebook, and Twitter. We may request access to your website backend to do that, or we can work with your website developer at that stage. We can also assist you with DNS settings, for instance if you prefer the URL to be “https://scorecard.example.com” instead of “https://example.com/scorecard.”\n  I live in a state that usually has three, but sometimes one or two representatives per district. Can you make a map like that? Yes. We build custom maps to suit your real-world needs.\n  Redistricting will force a map change. How do we handle that? Redistricting usually happens only once every 10 years. (We do have a lot of redistricting projects coming up.) Once the new districts are known, we will create a new boundary or dot map layer, and modify the spreadsheet, accordingly.\n  What’s a fun fact about the word “choropleth?” Note that the first two syllables (“Choro”) have no “L” in the word. From Ancient Greek χώρα (khṓra, “location”) + πλῆθος (plêthos, “a great number”). The founder of Roswell Infographics (Marjorie Roswell) majored in botany, and also loves chlorophyll, but that has an entirely different etymology: from Ancient Greek χλωρός (khlōrós, “pale green”) and φύλλον (phúllon, “leaf”).\n  ","date":"01","image":null,"permalink":"/faq/","tags":null,"title":"FAQ"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Effective Date: July 5, 2021\nApplicable To The Following Website:\nroswellinfographics.com\nArticle 1 - DEFINITIONS:\na) APPLICABLE WEBSITE: This Privacy Policy will refer to and be applicable to the Website listed above, which shall hereinafter be referred to as \u0026quot;Website.\u0026quot; Any listed Website may also refer to a corresponding mobile application, should one be currently in use or hereinafter developed.\nb) EFFECTIVE DATE: \u0026quot;Effective Date\u0026quot; means the date this Privacy Policy comes into force and effect.\nc) PARTIES: The parties to this privacy policy are the following data controller: Marjorie Roswell (\u0026quot;Data Controller\u0026quot;) and you, as the user of this Website.
